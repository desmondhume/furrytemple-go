###Furrytemple go packages

This repo contains a bunch of packages for crawling, parsing and storing/using data from the web. They're all meant to be used together, since they're the base of an ongoing project.

p.s.: I know there are a lot of awesome crawling/parsing/etc go packages out there, but I'm trying to understand as much as I can by doing it with my very own hands.

####Note
I'm learning go, and I'm still at the very beginning of the path, and that's the reason why A LOT of errors and noob mistakes might be standing in the code. If you want to help or just give me some advice (they'd be VERY VERY VERY VERY WELCOME), just open an issue or a pull request, or send me an email.
I'll try to document every part of the code both for myself, and for everybody who might want to know what's going on.
